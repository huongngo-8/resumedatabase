# Resume Database Project

This project was created to build a resume database for TechTogether, a non-profit organization that aims to elevate the hackathon experience and make it more inclusive by initiating hackathon events that focus on marginalized genders in the tech industry. The code in this project assists with the retrieval of data from resumes by using resume_parser-a resume parsing package-the cleaning and transformation of the raw resume data and the transfer of cleaned data to a database that was built with search and filtering capabilities.
